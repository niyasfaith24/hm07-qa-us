# Sprint 7 project

## Description
The project is about learning JavaScript which involves creating tests for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests against the Urban Grocers API

## Technologies and Techniques
- Git and Git Hub- This tool was used to track different changes through out the project
- JavaScript - This is used for scripting language used to write tests
- Node.js - This is used for runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server side
- API Urban Grocers- This is where you can find your endpoints for POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE


## Running Tests
Acces GitHub, Gitbash and Visual Studio Code
Run npm install from console in project folder
In config.js folder add server link
Open API Urban Grocers website to obtain endpoints
Open Postman to test API
Once API has past go to Visual Studio Code and add your endpoints to the code
Then go to Terminal and add NPX Jest to run the test
Once everything has past you add git add .
git commit -m "my commit"
git push
git push --force so everything can update from visual studio code to GitHub
